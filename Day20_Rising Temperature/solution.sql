-- Day 20: Rising Temperature
-- Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/
-- Category: SQL / Joins / Window Functions

/* ============================================================
   Option A (MySQL 8+ / Postgres): Window function + date check
   - Use LAG to get yesterdayâ€™s temp and date.
   - Ensure it is exactly the previous calendar day (no gaps).
   ============================================================ */

/* ============================================================
   Option B (Portable / MySQL / Postgres / SQLite-compatible):
   Self-join previous day by exact date difference of 1 day.
   ============================================================ */
-- MySQL / Postgres (MySQL: DATEDIFF(d1, d2) returns days between)
-- Postgres: use (recordDate - prev.recordDate) = 1 instead of DATEDIFF
