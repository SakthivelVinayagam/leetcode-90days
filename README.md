# LeetCode 90-Day Roadmap

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository documents my **90-day structured practice plan** for LeetCode, tailored for **Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, and BI Developer** career paths.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Solve **120 problems** (90 Algorithm + 30 SQL) over 90 days.  
- Cover **core patterns**: Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming.  
- Build strong SQL foundations (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, Window Functions, Optimization).  
- Simulate **12 weekly mock interviews**.  
- Maintain a reusable knowledge base of problem-solving strategies.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- Each dayâ€™s work is stored in a separate folder with:
  - `solution.py` â†’ Python code (clean, commented).
  - `notes.md` â†’ Explanation, approach, complexity, patterns.  
- SQL solutions are grouped in `/SQL`.  
- Mock interview reflections are in `/Mocks`.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Career Connection
- **Data Scientist / Analyst** â†’ SQL, Arrays/Strings, DP.  
- **ML Engineer** â†’ Trees, Graphs, DP, System Design.  
- **BI Developer** â†’ SQL-heavy + Data transformation logic.  

## ðŸš€ Outcome
By the end of 90 days:  
- ~120 solved problems with documented solutions.  
- Strong foundation in **algorithms, data structures, and SQL**.  
- Enhanced speed, accuracy, and problem-solving confidence for technical interviews.

## Structure
- Each dayâ€™s work is stored in its own folder:
  - `solution.py` â€” clean, commented Python code
  - `notes.md` â€” explanation, approach, complexity, patterns
- SQL solutions in `/SQL`
- Mock interview reflections in `/Mocks`
- Progress tracked in an Excel/Sheets tracker

## Career Connection
- **Data Scientist / Analyst** â†’ SQL, Arrays/Strings, DP
- **ML Engineer** â†’ Trees, Graphs, DP, System Design
- **BI Developer** â†’ SQL-heavy + data transformation logic

## Outcome
By the end of 90 days:
- ~120 solved problems with documented solutions
- Strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and SQL
- Faster, more confident technical interviewing
