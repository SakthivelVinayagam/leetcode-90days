# LeetCode 90-Day Roadmap

This repository documents my 90-day structured practice plan for LeetCode, tailored for career paths in Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning Engineering, and Business Intelligence Development.

---

## Goals
- Solve 120 problems (90 Algorithm + 30 SQL) over 90 days  
- Master core problem-solving patterns: Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming  
- Strengthen SQL foundations: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, Window Functions, Optimization  
- Simulate 12 weekly mock interviews  
- Maintain a reusable knowledge base of problem-solving strategies  

---

## Structure
- Each day’s work is stored in its own folder:
  - `solution.py` — clean, commented Python code
  - `notes.md` — explanation, approach, complexity, patterns
- SQL solutions are organized in `/SQL`
- Mock interview reflections in `/Mocks`
- Progress tracked in an Excel/Sheets tracker

---

## Career Connection
- Data Scientist / Analyst → SQL, Arrays/Strings, Dynamic Programming  
- Machine Learning Engineer → Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, System Design  
- BI Developer → SQL-heavy and data transformation logic  

---

## Outcome
By the end of 90 days, this repository will include:
- Approximately 120 solved problems with documented solutions  
- A strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and SQL  
- Improved speed, accuracy, and problem-solving confidence for technical interviews
